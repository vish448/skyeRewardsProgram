# Skye Reward Program ðŸ’³

Skye retailer offers a rewards program to its customers, awarding points based on each recorded purchase.
A customer receives 2 points for every dollar spent over $100 in each transaction, plus 1 point for every
dollar spent over $50 in each transaction
(e.g. a $120 purchase = 2x$20 + 1x$50 = 90 points).

Given a record of every transaction during a three month period, calculate the reward points earned for
each customer per month and total.

This project is bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
